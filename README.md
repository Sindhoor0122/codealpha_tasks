Credit Scoring Model 🚀
Predicting Creditworthiness of Individuals
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a credit scoring model that predicts the creditworthiness of individuals based on their historical financial data. The model uses classification algorithms to determine whether a person is likely to default or be creditworthy.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains financial history, income details, loan repayment records, and other relevant features.
Target Variable: "Creditworthiness" (0 = Not Creditworthy, 1 = Creditworthy)
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
📊 Model & Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Checked for missing values and outliers.
Visualized correlations between features.
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.
Encoded categorical features.
Standardized numerical data.
Model Training:

Implemented multiple classification models:
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Used Cross-Validation for better accuracy.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy: ✅ 96%
Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

📌 Results & Insights
The model successfully predicts whether an individual is creditworthy.
Can be improved using hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).
Deployment via Flask or Streamlit can make it accessible.
